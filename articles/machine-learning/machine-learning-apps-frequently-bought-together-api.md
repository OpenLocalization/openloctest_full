# Machine Learning example app: Frequently Bought Together


## IMPORTANT: THIS SERVICE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED

The Frequently Bought Together functionality that this service provides has now been integrated into our more broad [Recommendations API] (http://gallery.azureml.net/MachineLearningAPI/3574432384684cac9cc766e57729ea4c). We encourage you to use Recommendations instead of this service.

##Overview

The [Frequently Bought Together web service]( https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/amla/mba) in Machine Learning performs online shopping cart analysis to produce product recommendations of items frequently bought together from historical transactions. Frequently Bought Together recommendations help shoppers identify products in a catalog that are most relevant when purchasing a specific item. Prominently showing these recommendations has proven effective in improving sales for online retailers.
