# Learning Guide: Advanced data processing in Azure 

This map walks through the process of preparing data to be used in an Azure Machine Learning experiment. It shows how to move, process, and sample data to prepare it for machine learning. The data preparation process described here is a step in the map provided in the [Build advanced analytics solutions in Azure](machine-learning-data-science-how-to-create-machine-learning-service.md). The ADAPT guide outlines the data science tasks typically involved in building and deploying predictive models with Azure Machine Learning.
