# DocumentDB indexing policies

DocumentDB is a true schema-free database. It does not assume or require any schema for the JSON documents it indexes. This allows you to quickly define and iterate on application data models. As you add documents to a collection, DocumentDB automatically indexes all document properties so they are available for you to query. Automatic indexing also allows you to store heterogeneous types of documents.

Automatic indexing of documents is enabled by write optimized, lock free, and log structured index maintenance techniques. DocumentDB supports a sustained volume of fast writes while still serving consistent queries.

The DocumentDB indexing subsystem is designed to support:

-  Efficient, rich hierarchical and relational queries without any schema or index definitions.
-  Consistent query results while handling a sustained volume of writes. For high write throughput workloads with consistent queries, the index is updated incrementally, efficiently, and online while handling a sustained volume of writes.
- Storage efficiency. For cost effectiveness, the on-disk storage overhead of the index is bounded and predictable.
- Multi-tenancy. Index updates are performed within the budget of system resources allocated per DocumentDB collection. 

For most applications, you can use the default automatic indexing policy as it allows for the most flexibility and sound tradeoffs between performance and storage efficiency. On the other hand, specifying a custom indexing policy allows you to make granular tradeoffs between query performance, write performance, and index storage overhead.  

For example, by excluding certain documents or paths within documents from indexing, you can reduce both the storage space used for indexing, as well as the insert time cost for index maintenance. You can change the type of index to be better suited for range queries, or increase the index precision in bytes to improve query performance. This article describes the various indexing configuration options available in DocumentDB, and how to customize indexing policy for your workloads.

After reading this article, you'll be able to answer the following questions: 

- How does DocumentDB support indexing of all properties by default?
- How can I override the properties to include or exclude from indexing?
- How can I configure the index for eventual updates?
- How can I configure indexing to perform Order By or range queries?


## How DocumentDB indexing works

The indexing in DocumentDB takes advantage of the fact that JSON grammar allows documents to be **represented as trees**. For a JSON document to be represented as a tree, a dummy root node needs to be created which parents the rest of the actual nodes in the document underneath. Each label including the array indices in a JSON document becomes a node of the tree. The figure below illustrates an example JSON document and its corresponding tree representation.

![Indexing Policies](media/documentdb-indexing-policies/image001.png)

For example, the JSON property {"headquarters": "Belgium"} property in the above example corresponds to the path /"headquarters"/"Belgium". The JSON array {"exports": [{"city": â€œMoscow"}, {"city": Athens"}]} correspond to the paths /"exports"/0/"city"/"Moscow" and /"exports"/1/"city"/"Athens".

>[AZURE.NOTE] The path representation blurs the boundary between the structure/schema and the instance values in documents, allowing DocumentDB to be truly schema-free.

In DocumentDB, documents are organized into collections that can be queried using SQL, or processed within the scope a single transaction. Each collection can be configured with its own indexing policy expressed in terms of paths. In the following section, we will take a look at how to configure the indexing behavior of a DocumentDB collection.

## Configuring the indexing policy of a collection

The following sample shows how to set a custom indexing policy during  the creation of a collection, by using the DocumentDB REST API. The sample shows the indexing policy expressed in terms of paths, index types, and precisions.

    POST https://<REST URI>/colls HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json 

    {
       "id":"customIndexCollection",
       "indexingPolicy":{
          "automatic":true,
          "indexingMode":"Consistent",
          "includedPaths":[
             {
                "path":"/*",
                "indexes":[
    
                ]
             }
          ],
          "excludedPaths":[
             {
                "path":"/nonIndexedContent/*"
             }
          ]
       }
    }
     ...

>[AZURE.NOTE] The JSON schema for indexing policy has been changed with the release of REST API version 2015-06-03 to support Range indexes against strings. .NET SDK 1.2.0 and Java, Python, and Node.js SDKs 1.1.0 support the new policy schema. Older SDKs use the REST API version 2015-04-08 and support the older schema of Indexing Policy.

### Automatic indexing

You can choose if you want the collection to automatically index all documents or not. By default, all documents are automatically indexed, but you can choose to turn it off. When indexing is turned off, documents can be accessed only through their self-links or by
queries using ID.

With automatic indexing turned off, you can still selectively add only specific documents to the index. Conversely, you can leave automatic indexing on and selectively choose to exclude only specific documents. Indexing on/off configurations are useful when you have only a subset of documents that need to be queried.

You can configure the default policy by specifying the value for the automatic property to be true or false. To override for a single document, you can set the x-ms-indexingdirective request header while inserting or replacing a document.

For example, the following sample shows how to include a document explicitly using the [DocumentDB .NET SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-java) and the [RequestOptions.IndexingDirective](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.documents.client.requestoptions.indexingdirective.aspx) property.

    // If you want to override the default collection behavior to either
    // exclude (or include) a Document from indexing,
    // use the RequestOptions.IndexingDirective property.
    client.CreateDocumentAsync(defaultCollection.SelfLink,
        new { id = "AndersenFamily", isRegistered = true },
        new RequestOptions { IndexingDirective = IndexingDirective.Include });
        


### Indexing modes

You can choose between synchronous (**Consistent**) and asynchronous (**Lazy**) index updates. By default, the index is updated synchronously on each insertion, replacement, or deletion action taken on a document in the collection. This enables the queries to honor the same consistency level as that of the document reads without any delay for the index to catch up.

While DocumentDB is write optimized and supports sustained volumes of document writes along with synchronous index maintenance, you can configure certain collections to update their index lazily. Lazy indexing is great for scenarios where data is written in bursts, and you want to amortize the work required to index content over a longer period of time. This allows you to use your provisioned throughput effectively, and serve write requests at peak times with minimal latency.  With lazy indexing turned on, query results will eventually be consistent regardless of the consistency level configured for the database account.

The following sample show how create a DocumentDB collection using the .NET SDK with consistent automatic indexing on all document insertions.


     // Default collection creates a hash index for all string and numeric    
     // fields. Hash indexes are compact and offer efficient
     // performance for equality queries.
     
     var collection = new DocumentCollection { Id ="defaultCollection" };
     
     // Optional. Override Automatic to false for opt-in indexing of documents.
     collection.IndexingPolicy.Automatic = true;
     
     // Optional. Set IndexingMode to Lazy for bulk import/read heavy        
     // collections. Queries might return stale results with Lazy indexing.
     collection.IndexingPolicy.IndexingMode = IndexingMode.Consistent;
     
     collection = await client.CreateDocumentCollectionAsync(database.SelfLink, collection);

### Index types and precision

The type or scheme used for index entries has a direct impact on index storage and performance. For a scheme using higher precision, queries are typically faster. However, there is also a higher storage overhead for the index. Choosing a lower precision means that more documents might have to be processed during query execution, but the storage
overhead will be lower.

The index precision for values at any path can be between 1 and 8, or set to -1 indicating that the path must utilize the maximum required precision. Each path can be configured with an array of indexes, one for each data type (String and Number) and specifying the precision for each.

There are also two supported kinds of index types: Hash and Range. Choosing an index type of **Hash** enables efficient equality queries. For most use cases, hash indexes do not need a higher precision than the default value of 3 bytes.

Choosing an index type of **Range** enables range queries (using >, <, >=, <=, !=) as well as **Order By** queries. Order By queries also by default require that the range index is created with the maximum index precision (-1) in order to guarantee the total order of results.

For paths that have large ranges of values, it is recommended to use a higher precision like 6 bytes. A common use case that requires a higher precision range index is timestamps stored as epoch time.

If your use case does not require Order BY and/or efficient range queries, then the default of hash indexes offer the best trade off of storage and performance. Note that to support order by or range queries, you must specify a custom/non-default index policy.

The following example shows how to increase the precision for range indexes in a collection using the .NET SDK. Note that this uses a special path "/" â€“ which is explained in the next section.

    var rangeDefault = new DocumentCollection { Id = "rangeCollection" };
    
    rangeDefault.IndexingPolicy.IncludedPaths.Add(
        new IncludedPath { 
            Path = "/*", 
            Indexes = new Collection<Index> { 
                new RangeIndex(DataType.String) { Precision = -1 }, 
                new RangeIndex(DataType.Number) { Precision = -1 }
            }
        });

    await client.CreateDocumentCollectionAsync(database.SelfLink, rangeDefault);   


### Index paths

Within documents, you can choose which paths must be included or excluded from indexing. This can offer improved write performance and lower index storage for scenarios when the query patterns are known beforehand.

Index paths start with the root (/) and typically end with the ? wildcard operator, denoting that there are multiple possible values for the prefix. For example, to serve SELECT * FROM Families F WHERE F.familyName = "Andersen", you must include an index path for /familyName/? in the collectionâ€™s index policy.

Index paths can also use the * wildcard operator to specify the behavior for paths recursively under the prefix. For example, /payload/* can be used to exclude everything under the payload property from indexing.

Here are the common patterns for specifying index paths:

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

            <td valign="top">

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

>[AZURE.NOTE] While setting custom index paths, you are required to specify the default indexing rule for the entire document tree denoted by the special path "/*". 

The following example configures a specific path with range indexing and a custom precision value of 20 bytes:

    var collection = new DocumentCollection { Id = "rangeSinglePathCollection" };    
    
    collection.IndexingPolicy.IncludedPaths.Add(
        new IncludedPath { 
            Path = "/Title/?", 
            Indexes = new Collection<Index> { 
                new RangeIndex(DataType.String) { Precision = 20 } } 
            });

    collection.IndexingPolicy.IncludedPaths.Add(
        new IncludedPath { 
            Path = "/*" 
        });
        
    collection = await client.CreateDocumentCollectionAsync(database.SelfLink, pathRange);


DocumentDB returns an error when a query uses a Order By but does not have a range index against the queried path with the maximum precision. An error is returned for queries with range operators like >= if there is no range index (of any precision), but those can be served if there are other filters that can be served from the index. Range queries can be performed without a range index using the x-ms-documentdb-enable-scans header in the REST API or the EnableScanInQuery request option using the .NET SDK. 

Similarly paths can be completely excluded from indexing. The next example shows how to exclude an entire section of the documents (a.k.a. a sub-tree) from indexing using the "*" wildcard.

    var collection = new DocumentCollection { Id = "excludedPathCollection" };
    collection.IndexingPolicy.IncludedPaths.Add(new IncludedPath { Path = "/" });
    collection.IndexingPolicy.ExcludedPaths.Add(new ExcludedPath { Path = "/nonIndexedContent/*");
    
    collection = await client.CreateDocumentCollectionAsync(database.SelfLink, excluded);


## Performance tuning

As you evaluate different indexing policy configurations, you should measure the storage and throughput implications of the policy through the DocumentDB APIs.

To check the storage quota and usage of a collection, run a HEAD or GET request against the collection resource, and inspect the x-ms-request-quota and the x-ms-request-usage headers. In the .NET SDK, the [DocumentSizeQuota](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn850325.aspx) and [DocumentSizeUsage](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn850324.aspx) properties in [ResourceResponse<T\>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn799209.aspx) contain these corresponding values.

     // Measure the document size usage (which includes the index size) against   
     // different policies.        
     ResourceResponse<DocumentCollection> collectionInfo = await client.ReadDocumentCollectionAsync(collectionSelfLink);  
     Console.WriteLine("Document size quota: {0}, usage: {1}", collectionInfo.DocumentQuota, collectionInfo.DocumentUsage);


To measure the overhead of indexing on each write operation (create, update, or delete), inspect the x-ms-request-charge header (or the equivalent [RequestCharge](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn799099.aspx) property in [ResourceResponse<T\>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn799209.aspx) in the .NET SDK) to measure the number of request units consumed by these operations.

     // Measure the performance (request units) of writes.     
     ResourceResponse<Document> response = await client.CreateDocumentAsync(collectionSelfLink, myDocument);              
     Console.WriteLine("Insert of document consumed {0} request units", response.RequestCharge);
     
     // Measure the performance (request units) of queries.    
     IDocumentQuery<dynamic> queryable =  client.CreateDocumentQuery(collectionSelfLink, queryString).AsDocumentQuery();                                  
     double totalRequestCharge = 0;
     while (queryable.HasMoreResults)
     {
        FeedResponse<dynamic> queryResponse = await queryable.ExecuteNextAsync<dynamic>(); 
        Console.WriteLine("Query batch consumed {0} request units",queryResponse.RequestCharge);
        totalRequestCharge += queryResponse.RequestCharge;
     }
     
     Console.WriteLine("Query consumed {0} request units in total", totalRequestCharge);

## Changes to the indexing policy specification
A change in the schema for indexing policy was introduced on July 7, 2015 with REST API version 2015-06-03. The corresponding classes in the SDK versions have new implementations to match the schema. 

The following changes were implemented in the JSON specification:

- Indexing Policy supports Range indexes for strings
- Each path can have multiple index definitions, one for each data type
- Indexing precision supports 1-8 for numbers, 1-100 for strings, and -1 (maximum precision)
- Paths segments do not require a double quotation to escape each path. For example, you can add a path for /title/? instead of /"title"/?
- The root path representing "all paths" can be represented as /* (in addition to /)

If you have code that provisions collections with a custom indexing policy written with version 1.1.0 of the .NET SDK or older, you will need to change your application code to handle these changes in order to move to SDK version 1.2.0. If you do not have code that configures indexing policy, or plan to continue using an older SDK version, no changes are required.

Here are some samples showing the difference between the API version 2015-06-03 and the previous version 2015-04-08.
