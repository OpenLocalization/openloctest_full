#Azure Media Services Overview

Microsoft Azure Media Services is an extensible cloud-based platform that enables developers to build scalable media management and delivery applications. Media Services is based on REST APIs that enable you to securely upload, store, encode and package video or audio content for both on-demand and live streaming delivery to various clients (for example, TV, PC, and mobile devices).

You can build end-to-end workflows using entirely Media Services. You can also choose to use third-party components for some parts of your workflow. For example, encode using a third-party encoder. Then, upload, protect, package, deliver using Media Services.

To build Media Services solutions, you can use:

- [Media Services REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh973617.aspx)
- One of the available client SDKs: [Azure Media Services SDK for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-media-services), [Azure SDK for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java), [Azure Media Services for Node.js](https://github.com/fritzy/node-azure-media), [Azure PHP SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-php)
- Existing tools: [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/) or [Azure-Media-Services-Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer).


The following poster depicts Azure Media Services workflows, from media creation through consumption. You can download the poster from here: [Azure Media Services poster](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=38195).
