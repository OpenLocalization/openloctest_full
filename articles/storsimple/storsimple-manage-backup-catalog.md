# Manage your StorSimple backup catalog

## Overview

The **Backup Catalog** page displays all the backup sets that are created when manual or automated backups are taken. You can use this page to list all the backups for a backup policy or a volume, select or delete backups, or use a backup to restore or clone a volume.

This tutorial explains how to list, select, and delete a backup set. To learn how to restore your device from backup, go to [Restore your device from a backup set](storsimple-restore-from-backup-set.md). To learn how to clone a volume, go to [Clone a StorSimple volume](storsimple-clone-volume.md).

**Figure 1: Backup catalog**

The **Backup Catalog** page provides a query to narrow your backup set selection. You can filter the backup sets that are retrieved, based on the following parameters:

- **Device** – The device on which the backup set was created.

- **Backup Policy or Volume** – The backup policy or volume associated with this backup set.

- **From and To** – The date and time range when the backup set was created.

The filtered backup sets are then tabulated based on the following attributes:

- **Name** – The name of the backup policy or volume associated with the backup set.

- **Size** – The actual size of the backup set.

- **Created** On – The date and time when the backups were created. 

- **Type** – Backup sets can be local snapshots or cloud snapshots. A local snapshot is a backup of all your volume data stored locally on the device, whereas a cloud snapshot refers to the backup of volume data residing in the cloud. Local snapshots provide faster access, whereas cloud snapshots are chosen for data resiliency.

- **Initiated By** – The backups can be initiated automatically by a schedule or manually by a user. You can use a backup policy to schedule backups. Alternatively, you can use the **Take backup** option to take an interactive backup.
