# How to Capture a Linux Virtual Machine to Use as a Template##

This article shows you how to capture an Azure virtual machine running Linux so you can use it like a template to create other virtual machines. This template includes the OS disk and any data disks attached the virtual machine. It doesn't include networking configuration, so you'll need to configure that when you create the other virtual machines that use the template.

Azure treats this template as an image and stores it under **My Images**. This is also where any images you've uploaded are stored. For more information about images, see [About Virtual Machine Images in Azure] [].

##Before You Begin##

These steps assume that you've already created an Azure virtual machine and configured the operating system, including attaching any data disks. If you haven't done this yet, see these instructions:

- [How to Create a Custom Virtual Machine] []
- [How to Attach a Data Disk to a Virtual Machine] []

##Capture the Virtual Machine##

1. Connect to the virtual machine by clicking **Connect** on the command bar. For details, see [How to Log on to a Virtual Machine Running Linux][].

2. In the SSH window, type the following command.  Note that the output from `waagent` may vary slightly depending on the version of this utility:

	`$ sudo waagent -deprovision+user`

	This command will attempt to clean the system and make it suitable for re-provisioning. This operation performs the following tasks:

	- Removes SSH host keys (if Provisioning.RegenerateSshHostKeyPair is 'y' in the configuration file)
	- Clears nameserver configuration in /etc/resolv.conf
	- Removes the `root` user's password from /etc/shadow (if Provisioning.DeleteRootPassword is 'y' in the configuration file)
	- Removes cached DHCP client leases
	- Resets host name to localhost.localdomain
	- Deletes the last provisioned user account (obtained from /var/lib/waagent) **and associated data**.

	>[AZURE.NOTE] Deprovisioning deletes files and data in an effort to "generalize" the image. Only run this command on virtual machines that you intend to capture as a new image template.


3. Type **y** to continue.

	**Note** that you can add the `-force` parameter to avoid this confirmation step.

	>[AZURE.NOTE] Deprovisioning only generalizes the Linux image, but does not guarantee that the image is cleared of all sensitive information and is suitable for redistribution to third parties.


4. Type **Exit** to close the SSH client.

5. In the [Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com), select the virtual machine, and then click **Shut down**.

6. When the virtual machine is stopped, on the command bar, click **Capture** to open the **Capture the Virtual Machine** dialog box.

7.	In **Image Name**, type a name for the new image.

8.	All Linux images must be *deprovisioned* by running the `waagent` command with the `-deprovision` option. Click **I have run waagent-deprovision on the virtual machine** to indicate that the operating system is prepared to be an image.

9.	Click the check mark to capture the image.

	The new image is now available under **Images**. The virtual machine is deleted after the image is captured.

##Next Steps##
The image is ready to be used as a template to create virtual machines. To do this, you'll create a custom virtual machine by using the **From Gallery** method and select the image you just created. For instructions, see [How to Create a Custom Virtual Machine] [].
