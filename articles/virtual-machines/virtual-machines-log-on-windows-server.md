# How to Log on to a Virtual Machine Running Windows Server#

You'll use the **Connect** button in the Azure Portal to start a Remote Desktop session. (For Linux VMs, see [How to Log on to a Virtual Machine Running Linux](virtual-machines-linux-how-to-log-on.md).)

## How to log on

[AZURE.INCLUDE [virtual-machines-log-on-win-server](../../includes/virtual-machines-log-on-win-server.md)]

## Troubleshooting tips

Here are a few things to try quickly:

For problems with the Remote Desktop connection, try resetting the configuration from the portal. From the virtual machine dashboard, under **Quick Glance**, click **Reset remote configuration**.

For problems with your password, try resetting it from the portal. From the virtual machine dashboard, under **Quick Glance**, click **Reset password**.

If those don't work, you'll need to do more extensive troubleshooting. For instructions, see [Troubleshoot Remote Desktop connections to a Windows-based Azure Virtual Machine](virtual-machines-troubleshoot-remote-desktop-connections.md).
