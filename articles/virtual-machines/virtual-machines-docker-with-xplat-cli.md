# Using the Docker VM Extension from the Azure Command-line Interface (Azure CLI)

This topic describes how to create a VM with the Docker VM Extension from the service management (asm) mode in Azure CLI on any platform. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is one of the most popular virtualization approaches that uses [Linux containers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC) rather than virtual machines as a way of isolating data and computing on shared resources. You can use the Docker VM extension to the [Azure Linux Agent](virtual-machines-linux-agent-user-guide.md) to create a Docker VM that hosts any number of containers for your applications on Azure. To see a high-level discussion of containers and their advantages, see the [Docker High Level Whiteboard](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Regular-IT-Guy/Docker-High-Level-Whiteboard).

## <a id='How to use the Docker VM Extension with Azure'>How to use the Docker VM Extension with Azure</a>
To use the Docker VM extension with Azure, you must install a version of the [Azure Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools-xplat) (Azure CLI) higher than 0.8.6 (as of this writing the current version is 0.8.10). You can install the Azure CLI on Mac, Linux, and Windows.



The complete process to use Docker on Azure is simple:

+ Install the Azure CLI and its dependencies on the computer from which you want to control Azure (on Windows, this will be a Linux distribution running as a virtual machine)
+ Use the Azure CLI Docker commands to create a VM Docker host in Azure
+ Use the local Docker commands to manage your Docker containers in your Docker VM in Azure.


### Install the Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI)

To install and configure the Azure CLI, see [How to install the Azure Command-Line Interface](../xplat-cli-install.md). To confirm the installation, type `azure` at the command prompt and after a short moment you should see the Azure CLI ASCII art, which lists the basic commands available to you. If the installation worked correctly, you should be able to type `azure help vm` and see that one of the listed commands is "docker".

> [AZURE.NOTE] Docker has a setup program for Windows, [Boot2Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/), which you can also use to automate the creation of a docker client that you can use to work with Azure VMs as docker hosts.

### Connect the Azure CLI to to your Azure Account
Before you can use the Azure CLI you must associate your Azure account credentials with the Azure CLI on your platform. The section [How to connect to your Azure subscription](../xplat-cli-connect.md) explains how to either download and import your **.publishsettings** file or associate your Azure CLI with an organizational id.

> [AZURE.NOTE] There are some differences in behavior when using one or the other methods of authentication, so do be sure to read the document above to understand the different functionality.

### Install Docker and use the Docker VM Extension for Azure
Follow the [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation) to install Docker locally on your computer.

To use Docker with an Azure Virtual Machine, the Linux image used for the VM must have the [Azure Linux VM Agent](virtual-machines-linux-agent-user-guide.md) installed. Currently, there are only two types of images that provide this:

+ An Ubuntu image from the Azure Image Gallery or

+ A custom Linux image that you have created with the Azure Linux VM Agent installed and configured. See [Azure Linux VM Agent](virtual-machines-linux-agent-user-guide.md) for more information about how to build a custom Linux VM with the Azure VM Agent.

### Using the Azure Image Gallery

From a Bash or Terminal session, use the following Azure CLI command to locate the most recent Ubuntu image in the VM gallery to use by typing

`azure vm image list | grep Ubuntu-14_04`

and select one of the image names, such as `b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04-LTS-amd64-server-20140724-en-us-30GB`, and use the following command to create a new VM using that image.

```
azure vm docker create -e 22 -l "West US" <vm-cloudservice name> "b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04-LTS-amd64-server-20140724-en-us-30GB" <username> <password>
```

where:

+ *&lt;vm-cloudservice name&gt;* is the name of the VM that will become the Docker container host computer in Azure

+  *&lt;username&gt;* is the username of the default root user of the VM

+ *&lt;password&gt;* is the password of the *username* account that meets the standards of complexity for Azure

> [AZURE.NOTE] Currently, a password must be at least 8 characters, contain one lower case and one upper case character, a number, and a special character such as one of the following characters: `!@#$%^&+=`. No, the period at the end of the preceding sentence is NOT a special character.

If the command was successful, you should see something like the following, depending on the precise arguments and options you used:

![](./media/virtual-machines-docker-with-xplat-cli/dockercreateresults.png)

> [AZURE.NOTE] Creating a virtual machine can take a few minutes, but after it has been provisioned the Docker daemon (the Docker service) starts and you can connect to the Docker container host.

To test the Docker VM you have created in Azure, type

`docker --tls -H tcp://<vm-name-you-used>.cloudapp.net:2376 info`

where *<vm-name-you-used>* is the name of the virtual machine that you used in your call to `azure vm docker create`. You should see something similar to the following, which indicates that your Docker Host VM is up and running in Azure and waiting for your commands.

![](./media/virtual-machines-docker-with-xplat-cli/connectingtodockerhost.png)

### Docker Host VM Authentication
In addition to creating the Docker VM, the `azure vm docker create` command also automatically creates the necessary certificates to allow your Docker client computer to connect to the Azure container host using HTTPS, and the certificates are stored on both the client and host machines, as appropriate. On subsequent runs, the existing certificates are reused and shared with the new host.

By default, certificates are placed in `~/.docker`, and Docker will be configured to run on port **2376**. If you would like to use a different port or directory, then you may use one of the following `azure vm docker create` command line options to configure your Docker container host VM to use a different port or different certificates for connecting clients:

```
-dp, --docker-port [port]              Port to use for docker [2376]
-dc, --docker-cert-dir [dir]           Directory containing docker certs [.docker/]
```

The Docker daemon on the host is configured to listen for and authenticate client connections on the specified port using the certificates generated by the `azure vm docker create` command. The client machine must have these certificates to gain access to the Docker host.

> [AZURE.NOTE] A networked host running without these certificates will be vulnerable to anyone that can to connect to the machine. Before you modify the default configuration, ensure that you understand the risks to your computers and applications.
