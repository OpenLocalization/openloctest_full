# Create a Virtual Machine Running Linux

> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
- [Azure Portal](virtual-machines-linux-tutorial-portal-rm.md)
- [Azure CLI](virtual-machines-linux-tutorial.md)

Creating an Azure virtual machine (VM) that runs Linux is easy to do from the command line or from the portal. This tutorial shows you how to use the Azure Command-Line Interface for Mac, Linux, and Windows (the Azure CLI) to create quickly an Ubuntu Server VM running in Azure, connect to it using **ssh**, and creating and mounting a new disk. (This topic uses an Ubuntu Server VM, but you can also create Linux VMs using [your own images as templates](virtual-machines-linux-create-upload-vhd.md).)

[AZURE.INCLUDE [free-trial-note](../../includes/free-trial-note.md)]

## Install the Azure CLI

The first step is to [install the Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md).

Good. Now make sure you're in the resource management mode by typing `azure config mode arm`.

Even better. Now log in with your work or school id by typing `azure login` and following the prompts.

> [AZURE.NOTE] If you receive an error logging in, you may need to [create a work or school id from your personal Microsoft account](resource-group-create-work-id-from-personal.md).

## Create your Azure VM

Type `azure group create <my-group-name> westus` replacing _&lt;my-group-name&gt;_ with a group name that's unique to you (you can use a different region if you want). You should see something like the following:

	azure group create myuniquegroupname westus
	info:    Executing command group create
	+ Getting resource group myuniquegroupname
	+ Creating resource group myuniquegroupname
	info:    Created resource group myuniquegroupname
	data:    Id:                  /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/myuniquegroupname
	data:    Name:                myuniquegroupname
	data:    Location:            westus
	data:    Provisioning State:  Succeeded
	data:    Tags:
	data:
	info:    group create command OK

Now create your VM by typing `azure vm quick-create`, and you'll receive prompts to input the remaining parameters. Use the name of the resource group that you just created, above, and for the **ImageURN** value, use `canonical:ubuntuserver:14.04.2-LTS:latest`, so that your experience looks something like:

	azure vm quick-create
	info:    Executing command vm quick-create
	Resource group name: myuniquegroupname
	Virtual machine name: myuniquevmname
	Location name: westus
	Operating system Type [Windows, Linux]: Linux

Your VM is up and running and waiting for you to connect.

## Connecting to your VM

With Linux VMs, you typically connect using **ssh**. This topic connects to a VM using usernames and passwords; to use public and private key pairs to communicate with your VM, see [How to Use SSH with Linux on Azure](virtual-machines-linux-use-ssh-key.md).

If you're not familiar with connecting with **ssh**, the command takes the form `ssh <username>@<publicdnsaddress> -p <the ssh port>`. In this case, we use the username and password from the previous step and port 22, which is the default **ssh** port.

	ssh ops@myuni-westu-1432328437727-pip.westus.cloudapp.azure.com -p 22
	The authenticity of host 'myuni-westu-1432328437727-pip.westus.cloudapp.azure.com (191.239.51.1)' can't be established.
	ECDSA key fingerprint is bx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:x:x:x:x:x:x:xx.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

Now that you're connected to your VM, you're ready to attach a disk.

## Attach and mount a disk

Attaching a new disk is quick. Just type `azure vm disk attach-new <myuniquegroupname> <myuniquevmname> <size-in-GB>` to create and attach a new GB disk for your VM. It should look something like this:

	azure vm disk attach-new myuniquegroupname myuniquevmname 5
	info:    Executing command vm disk attach-new
	+ Looking up the VM "myuniquevmname"
	info:    New data disk location: https://cliexxx.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/myuniquevmname-20150526-0xxxxxxx43.vhd
	+ Updating VM "myuniquevmname"
	info:    vm disk attach-new command OK


Now let's find the disk, using `dmesg | grep SCSI` (the method you use to discover your new disk may vary). In this case, it looks something like:

	dmesg | grep SCSI
	[    0.294784] SCSI subsystem initialized
	[    0.573458] Block layer SCSI generic (bsg) driver version 0.4 loaded (major 252)
	[    7.110271] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk
	[    8.079653] sd 3:0:1:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk
	[ 1828.162306] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI disk

and in the case of this topic, the `sdc` disk is the one that we want. Now partition the disk with `sudo fdisk /dev/sdc` -- assuming that in your case the disk was `sdc`, and make it a primary disk on partition 1, and accept the other defaults.

	sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
	Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
	Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x2a59b123.
	Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
	After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

	Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

And write a file system to the partition by using the **mkfs** command, specifying your filesystem type and the device name. In this topic, we're using `ext4` and `/dev/sdc1` from above:

	sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdc1
	mke2fs 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014)
	Discarding device blocks: done
	Filesystem label=

	327680 inodes, 1310464 blocks
	65523 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
	First data block=0
	Maximum filesystem blocks=1342177280
	40 block groups
	32768 blocks per group, 32768 fragments per group
	8192 inodes per group
	Superblock backups stored on blocks:
		32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736

	Allocating group tables: done
	Writing inode tables: done
	Creating journal (32768 blocks): done
	Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done

Now we create a directory to mount the file system using `mkdir`:

	sudo mkdir /datadrive

And you mount the directory using `mount`:

	sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /datadrive

The data disk is now ready to use as `/datadrive`.

	ls
	bin   datadrive  etc   initrd.img  lib64       media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr  vmlinuz
	boot  dev        home  lib         lost+found  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can also connect to your Linux virtual machine using an SSH key for identification. For details, see [How to Use SSH with Linux on Azure](virtual-machines-linux-use-ssh-key.md).

## Next Steps

Remember, that your new disk will not typically be available to the VM if it reboots unless you write that information to your [fstab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab) file.
