#Wait Connector
Wait connector enables an app to delay its execution for a specified duration or until the occurrence of a specified time. When used in a flow, it can be used to delay execution.

##Using Wait Connector
To use the Wait connector, you need to first create an instance of the Wait Connector API app. This can be done either inline while creating a logic app or by selecting the Wait Connector API app from the Azure Marketplace.

##Using Wait Connector in the Logic Apps designer surface
Wait Connector can be used as an action. It does not have any triggers.

###Action
- Click on Wait Connector from the right pane.

	![List of Actions][1]
- Wait Connector supports two actions: 
	- Delay
	- Delay Until
	 
- Select *Delay*.

	![Delay input][2]
- Provide the inputs for the action and configure it.

	![Action configured][3]

## Do more with your Connector
Now that the connector is created, you can add it to a business flow using a Logic App. See [What are Logic Apps?](app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md).

You can also review performance statistics and control security to the connector. See [Manage  and Monitor API apps and connector](../app-service-api/app-service-api-manage-in-portal.md).
