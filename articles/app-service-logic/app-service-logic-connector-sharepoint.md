# Using the SharePoint Connector in your logic app

Logic apps can trigger based on a variety of data sources and offer connectors to get and process data as a part of the flow. Microsoft SharePoint connector lets you connect to Microsoft SharePoint Server or SharePoint Online and manage documents and list items. You can perform various actions such as create, update, get, and delete on documents and list items. When using on-premises SharePoint server, you enter the Service Bus Connection String as part of connector configuration and install the on-premises listener agent to connect to the server.

The SharePoint Online Connector and SharePoint Server Connector gallery app provides you Trigger and Actions as mechanisms to interact with SharePoint.

## Create a SharePoint Online Connector

A connector can be created within a logic app or be created directly from the Azure Marketplace. To create a connector from the Marketplace:

1. In the Azure startboard, select **Marketplace**.
2. Select **API Apps** and search for “SharePoint Online Connector”.
3. Enter the Name, App Service Plan, and other properties.
4. Enter the following package settings:

	Name | Required | Description
--- | --- | ---
Site URL | Yes | Enter the complete URL of the SharePoint web site. For example, enter: *https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/wabstest*.
Document Library / List Relative URLs | Yes | Enter the document libraries/lists URLs, relative to the SharePoint site URL, that are allowed to be modified by the connector. For example, enter: *Lists/Task, Shared Documents*.

5. When complete, the Package Settings look similar to the following:
<br/>

Once that’s done, you can now create a logic App in the same resource group to use the SharePoint Online Connector.

## Creating a SharePoint Server Connector

A connector can be created within a logic app or be created directly from the Azure Marketplace. To create a connector from the Marketplace:

1. In the Azure startboard, select **Marketplace**.
2. Select **API Apps** and search for “SharePoint Server Connector”.
3. Enter the Name, App Service Plan, and other properties.
4. Enter the following package settings:

	Name | Required | Description
--- | --- | ---
Site URL | Yes | Enter the complete URL of the SharePoint web site. For example, enter: *https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/wabstest*.
Authentication Mode | Yes | Enter the authentication mode to connect to SharePoint Site. Options include:<ul><li>Default</li><li>WindowsAuthentication</li><li>FormBasedAuthentication</li></ul><br/><br/>If you choose Default, the credentials running the SharePoint Connector are used; Username/Password are not required. Username and Password are required for other authentication types.<br/><br/>**Note** Anonymous authentication is not supported.
User Name | No | Enter a valid user name to connect to SharePoint site, if Authentication mode is not Default.
Password | No | Enter a valid password to connect to SharePoint site, if Authentication mode is not Default.
Document Library / List Relative URLs | Yes | Enter the document libraries/lists URLs, relative to the SharePoint site URL, that are allowed to be modified by the connector. For example, enter: *Lists/Task, Shared Documents*.
Service Bus Connection String | No | If you're connecting to on-premises, enter the Service Bus relay connection string.<br/><br/>[Using the Hybrid Connection Manager](app-service-logic-hybrid-connection-manager.md)<br/>[Service Bus Pricing](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/service-bus/)

Once that’s done, you can now create a logic App in the same resource group to use the SharePoint Server Connector.


## Using the SharePoint Connector in your Logic App

Once your API app is created, you can now use the SharePoint Connector as a trigger or action for your Logic App. To do this, you need to:

1. Create a new Logic App and choose the same resource group that has the SharePoint Connector.

2. Open **Triggers and Actions** to open the Logic Apps Designer and configure your workflow. The SharePoint Connector appears in the “Recently Used” section in the gallery on the right hand side. Select it.

3. If SharePoint connector is selected at the start of the logic app, it acts like trigger. Otherwise, actions could be taken on SharePoint account using the connector.

4. When using the SharePoint Online Connector, you have to authenticate and authorize logic apps to perform operations on your behalf. To start the authorization, click **Authorize** on SharePoint Connector:
<br/>
![][3]

5. Clicking Authorize would open SharePoint’s authentication dialog. Enter the sign in details of the SharePoint account on which you want to perform the operations:
<br/>
![][4]

6. Grant logic apps access to your account to perform operation on your behalf:
<br/>
![][5]

7. If the SharePoint Connector is configured as Trigger, then the triggers are shown. Otherwise, a list of actions is displayed and you can choose appropriate operation that you want to perform:

## Hybrid Configuration (Optional)

> [AZURE.NOTE] This step is required only if you are using SharePoint on-premises behind your firewall.

App Service uses the Hybrid Configuration Manager to connect securely to your on-premises system. If you're connector uses an on-premises SharePoint Server, the Hybrid Connection Manager is required.

See [Using the Hybrid Connection Manager](app-service-logic-hybrid-connection-manager.md).

## Do more with your Connector
Now that the connector is created, you can add it to a business workflow using a Logic App. See [What are Logic Apps?](app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md).

You can also review performance statistics and control security to the connector. See [Manage  and Monitor API apps and connector](app-service-api-manage-in-portal.md).
