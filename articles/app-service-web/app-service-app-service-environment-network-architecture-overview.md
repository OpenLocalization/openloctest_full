# Network Architecture Overview of App Service Environments

## Introduction ##
App Service Environments are always created within a subnet of a [virtual network][virtualnetwork], apps running in an App Service Environment can communicate with private endpoints located within the same virtual network topology.  Since customers may lock down parts of their virtual network infrastructure, it is important to understand the types of network communication flows that occur with an App Service Environment.

## General Network Flow ##
 
An App Service Environment always has a public virtual IP address (VIP).  All inbound traffic arrives on that public VIP including HTTP and HTTPS traffic for apps, as well as other traffic for FTP, remote debugging functionality, and Azure management operations.  For a full list of the specific ports (both required and optional) that are available on the public VIP see the article on [controlling inbound traffic][controllinginboundtraffic] to an App Service Environment. 

The diagram below shows an overview of the various inbound and outbound network flows:

![General Network Flows][GeneralNetworkFlows]

An App Service Environment can communicate with a variety of private customer endpoints.  For example, apps running in the App Service Environment can connect to database server(s) running on IaaS virtual machines in the same virtual network topology.  

App Service Environments also communicate with Sql DB and Azure Storage resources necessary for managing and operating an App Service Environment.  Some of the Sql and Storage resources that an App Service Environment communicates with are located in the same region as the App Service Environment, while others are located in remote Azure regions.  As a result, outbound connectivity to the Internet is always required for an App Service Environment to function properly. 

Since an App Service Environment is deployed in a subnet, network security groups can be used to control inbound traffic to the subnet.  For details on how to control inbound traffic to an App Service Environment, see the following [article][controllinginboundtraffic].

For details on how to allow outbound Internet connectivity from an App Service Environment, see the following article about working with [Express Route][ExpressRoute].  The same approach described in the article applies when working with Site-to-Site connectivity and using forced tunneling.

## Outbound Network Addresses ##
When an App Service Environment makes outbound calls, an IP Address is always associated with the outbound calls.  The specific IP address that is used depends on whether the endpoint being called is located within the virtual network topology, or outside of the virtual network topology.

If the endpoint being called is **outside** of the virtual network topology, then the outbound address (aka the outbound NAT address) that is used is the public VIP of the App Service Environment.  This address can be found in the portal user interface for the App Service Environment (note:  UX pending).  

This address can also be determined by creating an app in the App Service Environment, and then performing an *nslookup* on the app's address. The resultant IP address is the both the public VIP, as well as the App Service Environment's outbound NAT address.

If the endpoint being called is **inside** of the virtual network topology, the outbound address of the calling app will be the internal IP address of the individual compute resource running the app.  However there is not a persistent mapping of virtual network internal IP addresses to apps.  Apps can move around across different compute resources, and the pool of available compute resources in an App Service Environment can change due to scaling operations.

However, since an App Service Environment is always located within a subnet, you are guaranteed that the internal IP address of a compute resource running an app will always lie within the CIDR range of the subnet.  As a result, when fine-grained ACLs or network security groups are used to secure access to other endpoints within the virtual network, the subnet range containing the App Service Environment needs to be granted access.

The following diagram shows these concepts in more detail:

![Outbound Network Addresses][OutboundNetworkAddresses]

In the above diagram:

- Since the public VIP of the App Service Environment is 192.23.1.2, that is the outbound IP address used when making calls to "Internet" endpoints.
- The CIDR range of the containing subnet for the App Service Environment is 10.0.1.0/26.  Other endpoints within the same virtual network infrastructure will see calls from apps as originating from somewhere within this address range.
