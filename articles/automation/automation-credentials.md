# Credential assets in Azure Automation

An Automation credential asset holds a [PSCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.pscredential)  object which contains security credentials such as a username and password. Runbooks may use cmdlets that accept a PSCredential object for authentication, or the runbook may extract the username and password of the PSCredential object to provide to some application or service requiring authentication. The properties for a credential are stored securely in Azure Automation and can be accessed in the runbook with the [Get-AutomationPSCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.pscredential.aspx) activity.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Secure assets in Azure Automation include credentials, certificates, connections, and encrypted variables. These assets are encrypted and stored in the Azure Automation using a unique key that is generated for each automation account. This key is encrypted by a master certificate and stored in Azure Automation. Before storing a secure asset, the key for the automation account is decrypted using the master certificate and then used to encrypt the asset.

## Windows PowerShell cmdlets

The cmdlets in the following table are used to create and manage automation credential assets with Windows PowerShell.  They ship as part of the [Azure PowerShell module](../powershell-install-configure.md) which is available for use in Automation runbooks.

|Cmdlets|Description|
|:---|:---|
|[Get-AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn913781.aspx)|Retrieves information about a credential asset. You can only retrieve the credential itself from **Get-AutomationCredential** activity.|
|[New-AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj554330.aspx)|Creates a new Automation credential.|
|[Remove- AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj554330.aspx)|Removes an Automation credential.|
|[Set- AzureAutomationCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj554330.aspx)|Sets the properties for an existing Automation credential.|

## Runbook activities

The activities in the following table are used to access credentials in a runbook.

|Activities|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Get-AutomationPSCredential|Gets a credential to use in a runbook. Returns a [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.pscredential) object.|

>[AZURE.NOTE] You should avoid using variables in the –Name parameter of Get-AutomationPSCredential since this can complicate discovering dependencies between runbooks and credential assets at design time.

## Creating a new credential


### To create a new variable with the Azure portal

1. From your automation account, click **Assets** at the top of the window.
1. At the bottom of the window, click **Add Setting**.
1. Click **Add Credential**.
2. In the **Credential Type** dropdown, select **PowerShell Credential**.
1. Complete the wizard and click the checkbox to save the new credential.


### To create a new credential with the Azure preview portal

1. From your automation account, click the **Assets** part to open the **Assets** blade.
1. Click the **Credentials** part to open the **Credentials** blade.
1. Click **Add a credential** at the top of the blade.
1. Complete the form and click **Create** to save the new credential.


### To create a new PowerShell credential with Windows PowerShell

The following sample commands show how to create a new automation credential. A PSCredential object is first created with the name and password and then used to create the credential asset. Alternatively, you could use the **Get-Credential** cmdlet to be prompted to type in a name and password.

	$user = "MyDomain\MyUser"
	$pw = ConvertTo-SecureString "PassWord!" -AsPlainText -Force
	$cred = New-Object –TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential –ArgumentList $user, $pw
	New-AzureAutomationCredential -AutomationAccountName "MyAutomationAccount" -Name "MyCredential" -Value $cred

## Using a PowerShell credential in a runbook

You retrieve a credential asset in a runbook with the **Get-AutomationPSCredential** activity. This returns a [PSCredential object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.pscredential.aspx) that you can use with an activity or cmdlet that requires a PSCredential parameter. You can also retrieve the properties of the credential object to use individually. The object has a property for the username and the secure password, or you can use the **GetNetworkCredential** method to return a [NetworkCredential](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.networkcredential.aspx) object that will provide an unsecured version of the password.

### Textual runbook sample

The following sample commands show how to use a PowerShell credential in a runbook. In this example, the credential is retrieved and its username and password assigned to variables.

	$myCredential = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name 'MyCredential'
	$userName = $myCredential.UserName
	$securePassword = $myCredential.Password
	$password = $myCredential.GetNetworkCredential().Password


### Graphical runbook sample

You add a **Get-AutomationPSCredential** activity to a graphical runbook by right-clicking on the credential in the Library pane of the graphical editor and selecting **Add to canvas**.


![Add credential to canvas](media/automation-credentials/credential-add-canvas.png)

The following image shows an example of using a credential in a graphical runbook.  In this case, it is being used to provide authentication for a runbook to Azure resources as described in [Configuring authentication to Azure resources](#automation-configuring.md).  The first activity retrieves the credential that has access to the Azure subscription.  The **Add-AzureAccount** activity then uses this credential to provide authentication for any activities that come after it.  A [pipeline link](automation-graphical-authoring-intro.md#links-and-workflow) is here since **Get-AutomationPSCredential** is expecting a single object.
