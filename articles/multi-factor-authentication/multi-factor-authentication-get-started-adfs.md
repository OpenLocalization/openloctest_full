# Getting started with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication and Active Directory Federation Services



<center>![Cloud](./media/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-adfs/adfs.png)</center>

If your organization has federated your on-premises Active Directory with Azure Active Directory using AD FS, the following 2 options for using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication are available.

- Secure cloud resources using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication or Active Directory Federation Services 
- Secure cloud and on-premises resources using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server 

The following table summarizes the authentication experience between securing resources with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication and AD FS

|Authentication Experience - Browser based Apps|Authentication Experience - Non-Browser based Apps
:------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
Securing Azure AD resources using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication |<li>The 1st factor of authentication is performed on-premises using AD FS.</li> <li>The 2nd factor is a phone based method carried out using cloud authentication.</li>|End users can use app passwords to sign-in.
Securing Azure AD resources using Active Directory Federation Services |<li>The 1st factor of authentication is performed on-premises using AD FS.</li><li>The 2nd factor is performed on-premises by honoring the claim.</li>|End users can use app passwords to sign-in.

Caveats with app passwords for federated users: 

- App Password is verified using cloud authentication and hence bypasses federations. Federation is only actively used when setting up App Password.
- On-premises Client Access Control settings are not honored by App Password.
- You lose on-premises auth logging capability for App Password.
- Account disable/deletion may take up to 3 hours for dirsync, delaying disable/deletion of app password in the cloud identity.

For information on setting up either Azure Multi-Factor Authentication or the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server with AD FS see the following:
