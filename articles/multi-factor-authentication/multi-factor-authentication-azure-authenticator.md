# Moving to the new Azure Authenticator app

With the release of the Azure Authenticator app, available for [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/azure-authenticator/03a5b2bf-6066-418f-b569-e8aecbc06e50), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator), and [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/azure-authenticator/id983156458), the old Multi-Factor Authentication app is being replaced.  The Multi-Factor Authentication app will continue to work but should you decide to move to the new Azure Authenticator app then this article can assist you.

**Step 2:** Activate your accounts with the new app

First of all make sure, you have the QR code or code and URL for manual entry handy for the account you’d like to add to the app.

This will launch the camera to scan the QR code.  If you are unable to scan the QR code, you always have the manual entry option. 

To confirm that the account is successfully activated, verify that the new account shows up on the accounts pages. 


Follow this step for all your accounts that you’d like to migrate to the new app.



**Step 3:**  Uninstall the old Multi-Factor Authentication app from your phone.

Once you have added all the accounts to the new app uninstall the old app from your phone.

Curious how to remove individual accounts from the old app?
Tap on the account. You’ll get an option to “Delete”.
