# Use mobile app as your contact method with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

If you want to use the mobile app as your primary contact method you can use this article.  It will walk you through setting up multi-factor authentication to use your mobile app as your primary contact method.

The Azure Authenticator app is available for [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/azure-authenticator/03a5b2bf-6066-418f-b569-e8aecbc06e50), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator), and [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/azure-authenticator/id983156458).
