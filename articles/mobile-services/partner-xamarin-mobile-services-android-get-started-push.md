# Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-push](../../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-push.md)]

##Overview
This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to a Xamarin.Android app. In this tutorial you add push notifications using the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service to the [Get started with Mobile Services] project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.

This tutorial requires the following:

+ An active Google account.
+ [Google Cloud Messaging Client Component]. You will add this component during the tutorial.

You should already have the [Xamarin.Android] and the [Azure Mobile Services Component] installed in your project from when you completed either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Add Mobile Services to an existing app].
