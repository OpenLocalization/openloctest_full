# Site Recovery components

Azure Site Recovery contributes to your business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy by orchestrating replication, failover and recovery of virtual machines and physical servers. Machines can be replicated to Azure, or to a secondary on-premises data center. [Read an overview](site-recovery-overview.md).

This article summarizes and describes the Site Recovery components that are installed on servers and virtual machines.

You can post any questions about this article on the [Azure Recovery Services Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=hypervrecovmgr).

## Overview

### Protection between an on-premises physical server or VMware virtual machine and Azure 

In this scenario replication can happen in two ways:

- Over a VPN connection (using Azure ExpressRoute or a site-to-site VPN)
- Over a secure connection on the internet

#### Over a VPN site-to-site connection (or ExpressRoute)

Communications from on-premises servers are directed to internal ports on the Azure virtual network to which the configuration and master target virtual machines are connected.

![VMware or physical machine to Azure over the internet ](./media/site-recovery-components/Components_OnpremVMware2AzureVPN.png)

#### Over the internet

All communications from on-premises servers are directed to mapped public endpoints on the Azure cloud service for the configuration server virtual machine and master target server virtual machine. The endpoints are dynamically created when you deploy the virtual machines.

#### Ports

**Component** | **Port** | **Details** 
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Process server** |9080 | Protected machines send data for replication to the process server over TCP 9080.
**Configuration server** | HTTPS/443 | The Mobility service running on protected machines sends replication metadata to the configuration server on port 443.
 | HTTPS/443 | The configuration server coordinates and orchestrates machine protection. The process server communicates with the configuration server on 443 or the mapped public endpoint to receive management and control information. 
 | 9443 | In the failback direction, the vContinuum tool requests control and metadata from the configuration server on port 9443 (not shown on diagram)
 | 5986 | Remote management with PowerShell uses port 5986 (not shown on diagram)
 | 3389 | RDP connection to the configuration server using 3389 (not shown on diagram)
**Master target server** | 80 | The process site sends communications about replication traffic to the master target server over 9080
 | HTTP/443 | The process server replicates data to the master target server over HTTP or 443 (VPN)
 | HTTP/443 | The process server replicates data to the master target server over HTTP or 443 (VPN)
**Firewall rules** |  | <p>For push installation of the Mobility service to work correctly the firewall on protected machines should allow File and Printer Sharing and Windows Management Instrumentation.</p><p>The firewall rules on machines you want to protect should allow them to reach the configuration server.</p><p>To connect to Azure virtual machines over the internet after failover, firewall rules on the machines should allow Remote Desktop connections over the internet. To connect to a failed over Linux machine in Azure the Secure Shell service should be set to start automatically on system, and firewall rules should allow an ssh connection.</p>

## Planning for component deployment

### Azure Site Recovery Provider

The Provider runs on your VMM servers, Hyper-V host servers if you don't have a VMM server in your deployment, or on a configuration server. It connects to the Site Recovery service over the internet with an encrypted HTTPS connection. Note that:

- You don't need to add specific firewall exception to connect the Provider to Site Recovery.
- If you want the server on which the provider runs to connect to the internet using a proxy server you can either use the existing proxy settings, or specify a custom proxy.
- The proxy needs to allow these addresses through the firewall:

	-  *.accesscontrol.windows.net
	-  .backup.windowsazure.com
	-  *.blob.core.windows.net
	-  *.store.core.windows.net
	
- If you have IP address-based rules on your firewall make sure they allow communication from the configuration server to IP addresses described in [Azure Datacenter IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653) and for HTTPS (443). You'll need to whitelist IP address ranges of the Azure region you plan to use and for West US.
- If you're deploying Site Recovery with VMM and you use a custom proxy, a VMM RunAs account (DRAProxyAccount) will be created automatically using the proxy credentials you specify in the custom proxy settings in the Site Recovery portal. You'll need to set up the proxy server so that this account can authenticate successfully.
- If you're using a proxy traffic sent from the provider installed on a Hyper-V host server to the proxy must be sent over HTTP.

### Microsoft Recovery Services agent

The agent connects to the Site Recovery service over the internet with an encrypted HTTPS connection. No specify firewall exceptions are required.

### Components for VMware or physical server protection

#### Master target server

- The master target server can e Azure standard A4 or D14 virtual machine.
- With a standard A4 master target you can add 16 data disks (maximum of 1023 GB per data disk) to each virtual machine.
- With a standard D14 master target you can add 32 data disks (maximum of 1023 GB per data disk) to each virtual machine.
- A standard D14 sized master target server is required only if you wish to protect a server that has more than 15 disks attached to it; for all other configurations you can deploy standard A4 sized master target servers.
- Note that one disk attached to the master target server is reserved as a retention drive. Azure Site Recovery allows you to define retention windows and recover protected machines to a recovery point within that window. The retention drive maintains a journal of disk changes for the duration of the window.  This reduces the maximum disks available for replication on an A4 to 15 and on a D14 to 31.

#### Process server 

- The process server uses disk based cache. Ensure that there's enough free space C:/ for the cache. Cache sizing will be affected by the data change rate of the machines you're protecting. Generally we recommend a cache directory size of 600 GB for medium size deployments.
- You should deploy an additional process server if the data change rate of protected machines exceeds the capacity of an existing process server.
- To scale your deployment you add multiple process servers and master target servers. You should deploy a second master target server if you don't have enough free disks on an existing master target server.
-  Note that process servers and master target servers don't require one-to-one mapping. You can deploy the first process server with the second master target server and so on.

#### Configuration server

- The configuration server is a standard A3 virtual machine based on an Azure Site Recovery Windows Server 2012 R2 gallery image will be created in your subscription for the configuration server. It's created as the first instance in a new cloud service with a reserved public IP address.
- Installation path in English characters only.

#### Mobility service

Install on VMware virtual machines or physical servers. Machines and servers must comply with the  following requirements:

- **Windows servers**:
	-  64-bit operating system: Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2 with at least SP1.
	-  Host name, mount points, device names, Windows system path (eg: C:\Windows) in English only.
	-  The operating system  on C:\ drive.
	-  Only basic disks are supported. Dynamic disks aren't supported.

- **Linux servers**:
	- A supported 64 bit operating system: Centos 6.4, 6.5, 6.6; Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4, 6.5 running either the Red Hat compatible kernel or Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 3 (UEK3), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3.
	- /etc/hosts files on protected machines should contain entries that map the local host name to IP addresses associated with all NICs.
	- Host name, mount points, device names, and Linux system paths and file names (eg /etc/; /usr) in English only.
	-  Following storage supported: File system: EXT3, ETX4, ReiserFS, XFS/Multipath software-Device Mapper (multipath)/Volume manager: LVM2\. Physical servers with HP CCISS controller storage aren't supported.
