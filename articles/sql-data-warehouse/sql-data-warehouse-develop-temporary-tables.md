# Temporary tables in SQL Data Warehouse
Temporary tables exist at the session level in SQL Data Warehouse. They are defined as local temporary tables and unlike SQL Server tables they can be accessed from anywhere inside the session.

Temporary tables are very useful when processing data - especially during transformation where the intermediate results are transient.

This article highlights some specific methods for leveraging temporary tables to help you modularize your code. 

## Modularizing code

The fact that temporary tables can be seen anywhere in a user session can be exploited to help you modularize your application code.

Lets make a working example. 

The stored procedure below generates the DDL required to update the statistics on every column in the database:

```
CREATE PROCEDURE    [dbo].[prc_sqldw_update_stats]
(   @update_type    tinyint -- 1 default 2 fullscan 3 sample 4 resample
,   @sample_pct     tinyint
)
AS

IF @update_type NOT IN (1,2,3,4)
BEGIN;
    THROW 151000,'Invalid value for @update_type parameter. Valid range 1 (default), 2 (fullscan), 3 (sample) or 4 (resample).',1;
END;

IF @sample_pct IS NULL
BEGIN;
    SET @sample_pct = 20;
END;

CREATE TABLE #stats_ddl
WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([seq_nmbr])
        ,   LOCATION     = USER_DB
        )
WITH t1
AS
(
SELECT
		sm.[name]				                                                AS [schema_name]
,		tb.[name]				                                                AS [table_name]
,		st.[name]				                                                AS [stats_name]
,		st.[has_filter]			                                                AS [stats_is_filtered]
,       ROW_NUMBER()
        OVER(ORDER BY (SELECT NULL))                                            AS [seq_nmbr]
,								 QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [two_part_name]
,		QUOTENAME(DB_NAME())+'.'+QUOTENAME(sm.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(tb.[name])  AS [three_part_name]
FROM	sys.objects			AS ob
JOIN	sys.stats			AS st	ON	ob.[object_id]		= st.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.stats_columns	AS sc	ON	st.[stats_id]		= sc.[stats_id]
									AND st.[object_id]		= sc.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.columns			AS co	ON	sc.[column_id]		= co.[column_id]
									AND	sc.[object_id]		= co.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.tables			AS tb	ON	co.[object_id]		= tb.[object_id]
JOIN	sys.schemas			AS sm	ON	tb.[schema_id]		= sm.[schema_id]
WHERE	1=1
AND		st.[user_created]   = 1
GROUP BY
		sm.[name]
,		tb.[name]
,		st.[name]
,		st.[filter_definition]
,		st.[has_filter]
)
SELECT
    CASE @update_type
    WHEN 1
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+');'
    WHEN 2
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH FULLSCAN;'
    WHEN 3
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH SAMPLE '+CAST(@sample_pct AS VARCHAR(20))+' PERCENT;'
    WHEN 4
    THEN 'UPDATE STATISTICS '+[two_part_name]+'('+[stats_name]+') WITH RESAMPLE;'
    END AS [update_stats_ddl]
,   [seq_nmbr]
FROM    t1
;
```

Notice that nothing has actually been done with this data. The procedure has simply generated the DDL and stored it in a temporary table.

However, it is possible in SQL Data Warehouse to use that temporary table outside of the procedure that created it. This is different to SQL Server. In fact the temporary table can be used **anywhere** inside the session.

This can lead to more modular and manageable code.

```
EXEC [dbo].[prc_sqldw_update_stats] @update_type = 1, @sample_pct = NULL;

DECLARE @i INT              = 1
,       @t INT              = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM #stats_ddl)
,       @s NVARCHAR(4000)   = N''

WHILE @i <= @t
BEGIN
    SET @s=(SELECT update_stats_ddl FROM #stats_ddl WHERE seq_nmbr = @i);

    PRINT @s
    EXEC sp_executesql @s
    SET @i+=1;
END

DROP TABLE #stats_ddl;
```

In some cases inline and multi-statement functions can also be replaced using this technique.

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can also extend this solution. If you only wanted to update a single table for example all you would need to do is just filter the #stats_ddl table

## Temporary table limitations
SQL Data Warehouse does impose a couple of limitations when implementing temporary tables.

The main limitations are:

- Global Temporary Tables are not supported
- Views cannot be created on temporary tables
