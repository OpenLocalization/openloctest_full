# Table partitions in SQL Data Warehouse

To migrate SQL Server partition definitions to SQL Data Warehouse:

- Remove SQL Server partition functions and schemes since this is managed for you when you create the table.
- Define the partitions when you create the table. Simply specify partition boundary points and whether you want the boundary point to be effective `RANGE RIGHT` or `RANGE LEFT`.

### Partition sizing
Partition sizing is an important consideration for SQL Data Warehouse. Typically data management operations and data loading routines target individual partitions rather than tackling the whole table all at once. This is particularly relevant to clustered columnstores (CCI). CCI's can consume significant amounts of memory. Therefore, whilst we may want to revise the granularity of the partitioning plan we do not want to size the partitions to such a size that we run into memory pressure when trying to perform management tasks.

When deciding the granularity of the partitions it is important to remember that SQL Data Warehouse will automatically distribute the data into distributions. Consequently, data that would have normally existed in one table in one partition in an SQL Server database now exists in one partition across many tables in a SQL Data Warehouse database. To maintain a meaningful number of rows in each partition one typically changes the partition boundary size. For example, if you have used day level partitioning for your data warehouse you may want to consider something less granular such as month or quarter.

To size your current database at the partition level use a query like the one below:

```
SELECT      s.[name]                        AS      [schema_name]
,           t.[name]                        AS      [table_name]
,           i.[name]                        AS      [index_name]
,           p.[partition_number]            AS      [partition_number]
,           SUM(a.[used_pages]*8.0)         AS      [partition_size_kb]
,           SUM(a.[used_pages]*8.0)/1024    AS      [partition_size_mb]
,           SUM(a.[used_pages]*8.0)/1048576 AS      [partition_size_gb]
,           p.[rows]                        AS      [partition_row_count]
,           rv.[value]                      AS      [partition_boundary_value]
,           p.[data_compression_desc]       AS      [partition_compression_desc]
FROM        sys.schemas s
JOIN        sys.tables t                    ON      t.[schema_id]         = s.[schema_id]
JOIN        sys.partitions p                ON      p.[object_id]         = t.[object_id]
JOIN        sys.allocation_units a          ON      a.[container_id]        = p.[partition_id]
JOIN        sys.indexes i                   ON      i.[object_id]         = p.[object_id]
                                            AND     i.[index_id]          = p.[index_id]
JOIN        sys.data_spaces ds              ON      ds.[data_space_id]    = i.[data_space_id]
LEFT JOIN   sys.partition_schemes ps        ON      ps.[data_space_id]    = ds.[data_space_id]
LEFT JOIN   sys.partition_functions pf      ON      pf.[function_id]      = ps.[function_id]
LEFT JOIN   sys.partition_range_values rv   ON      rv.[function_id]      = pf.[function_id]
                                            AND     rv.[boundary_id]      = p.[partition_number]
WHERE       p.[index_id] <=1
GROUP BY    s.[name]
,           t.[name]
,           i.[name]
,           p.[partition_number]
,           p.[rows]
,           rv.[value]
,           p.[data_compression_desc]
;
```

The total number of distributions equals the number of storage locations used when we create a table. That's a complex way of saying that each table is created once per distribution.

You can also anticipate roughly how many rows, and therefore how big, each partition will be. The partition in the source data warehouse will be subdivided into each distribution.

Use the following calculation to guide you when determining your partition size:

MPP Partition Size = SMP Partition Size / Number of Distributions

You can find out how many distributions your SQL Data Warehouse database has using the following query:

```
SELECT  COUNT(*)
FROM    sys.pdw_distributions
;
```

Now you know how big each partition is in the source system and what size you are anticipating for SQLDW you can decide on your partition boundary.

### Workload manangement
One final piece of information you need to factor in to the table partition decision is workload management. In SQL Data Warehouse the maximum memory allocated to each distribution during query execution is governed by this feature. Please refer to the following article for more details on [workload management]. Ideally your partition will be sized with inmemory operations such as columnstore index rebuilds in mind. An index rebuild is a memory intensive operation. Therefore you will want to ensure that the partition index rebuild is not starved of memory. Increasing the amount of memory available to your query can be achieved by switching from the default role to one of the other roles available.

Information on the allocation of memory per distribution is available by querying the resource governor dynamic management views. In reality your memory grant will be less than the figures below. However, this provides a level of guidance that you can use when sizing your partitions for data management operations.

```
SELECT  rp.[name]								AS [pool_name]
,       rp.[max_memory_kb]						AS [max_memory_kb]
,       rp.[max_memory_kb]/1024					AS [max_memory_mb]
,       rp.[max_memory_kb]/1048576				AS [mex_memory_gb]
,       rp.[max_memory_percent]					AS [max_memory_percent]
,       wg.[name]								AS [group_name]
,       wg.[importance]							AS [group_importance]
,       wg.[request_max_memory_grant_percent]	AS [request_max_memory_grant_percent]
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_nodes_resource_governor_workload_groups	wg
JOIN    sys.dm_pdw_nodes_resource_governor_resource_pools	rp ON wg.[pool_id] = rp.[pool_id]
WHERE   wg.[name] like 'SloDWGroup%'
AND     rp.[name]    = 'SloDWPool'
```

> [AZURE.NOTE] Try to avoid sizing your partitions beyond the memory grant provided by the extra large resource class. If your partitions grow beyond this figure you run the risk of memory pressure which in turn leads to less optimal compression.

## Partition switching
To switch partitions between two tables you must ensure that the partitions align on their respective boundaries and that the table definitions match. As check constraints are not available to enforce the range of values in a table the source table must contain the same partition boundaries as the target table. If this is not the case then the parition switch will fail as the partition metadata will not be synchronised.

### How to split a partition that contains data
The most efficient method to split a partition that already contains data is to use a `CTAS` statement. If the partitioned table is a clustered columnstore then the table partition must be empty before it can be split.

Below is a sample partitioned columnstore table containing one row in the final partition:

```
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
(
        [ProductKey]            int          NOT NULL
    ,   [OrderDateKey]          int          NOT NULL
    ,   [CustomerKey]           int          NOT NULL
    ,   [PromotionKey]          int          NOT NULL
    ,   [SalesOrderNumber]      nvarchar(20) NOT NULL
    ,   [OrderQuantity]         smallint     NOT NULL
    ,   [UnitPrice]             money        NOT NULL
    ,   [SalesAmount]           money        NOT NULL
)
WITH
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    (20000101
                    )
                )
)
;

INSERT INTO dbo.FactInternetSales
VALUES (1,20010101,1,1,1,1,1,1)

CREATE STATISTICS Stat_dbo_FactInternetSales_OrderDateKey ON dbo.FactInternetSales(OrderDateKey)
```

> [AZURE.NOTE] By Creating the statistic object we ensure that table metadata is more accurate. If we omit creating statistics then SQL Data Warehouse will use default values. For details on statistics please review [statistics][].

We can then query for the row count leveraging the `sys.partitions` catalog view:

```
SELECT  QUOTENAME(s.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(t.[name]) as Table_name
,       i.[name] as Index_name
,       p.partition_number as Partition_nmbr
,       p.[rows] as Row_count
,       p.[data_compression_desc] as Data_Compression_desc
FROM    sys.partitions p
JOIN    sys.tables     t    ON    p.[object_id]   = t.[object_id]
JOIN    sys.schemas    s    ON    t.[schema_id]   = s.[schema_id]
JOIN    sys.indexes    i    ON    p.[object_id]   = i.[object_Id]
                            AND   p.[index_Id]    = i.[index_Id]
WHERE t.[name] = 'FactInternetSales'
```

If we try to split this table we will get an error:

```
ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales SPLIT RANGE (20020101)
```

Msg 35346, Level 15, State 1, Line 44
SPLIT clause of ALTER PARTITION statement failed because the partition is not empty.  Only empty partitions can be split in when a columnstore index exists on the table. Consider disabling the columnstore index before issuing the ALTER PARTITION statement, then rebuilding the columnstore index after ALTER PARTITION is complete.

However we can use `CTAS` to create a new table to hold our data.

```
CREATE TABLE dbo.FactInternetSales_20010101
    WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ProductKey)
            ,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
            ,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                                (20010101
                                )
                            )
            )
AS
SELECT *
FROM	FactInternetSales
WHERE	1=2
```

As the partition boundaries are aligned a switch is permitted. This will leave the source table with an empty partition that we can subsequently split.

```
ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales SWITCH PARTITION 2 TO  FactInternetSales_20010101 PARTITION 2

ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales SPLIT RANGE (20020101)
```

All that is left to do is to align our data to the new partition boundaries using `CTAS` and switch our data back in to the main table

```
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales_20010101_20020101]
    WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
            ,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
            ,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                                (20010101,20020101
                                )
                            )
            )
AS
SELECT  *
FROM	[dbo].[FactInternetSales_20010101]
WHERE	[OrderDateKey] >= 20010101
AND     [OrderDateKey] <  20020101

ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales_20010101_20020101 SWITCH PARTITION 3 TO  FactInternetSales PARTITION 3
```

Once you have completed the movement of the data it is a good idea to refresh the statistics on the target table to ensure they accurately reflect the new distribution of the data in their respective partitions:

```
UPDATE STATISTICS [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
```

### Table partitioning source control
To avoid your table definition from **rusting** in your source control system you may want to consider the following approach:

1. Create the table as a partitioned table but with no partition values

```
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
(
    [ProductKey]            int          NOT NULL
,   [OrderDateKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [CustomerKey]           int          NOT NULL
,   [PromotionKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [SalesOrderNumber]      nvarchar(20) NOT NULL
,   [OrderQuantity]         smallint     NOT NULL
,   [UnitPrice]             money        NOT NULL
,   [SalesAmount]           money        NOT NULL
)
WITH
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    ()
                )
)
;
```

2. `SPLIT` the table as part of the deployment process:

```
-- Create a table containing the partition boundaries

CREATE TABLE #partitions
WITH
(
    LOCATION = USER_DB
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ptn_no)
)
AS
SELECT  ptn_no
,       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (ptn_no)) as seq_no
FROM    (
        SELECT CAST(20000101 AS INT) ptn_no
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20010101 AS INT)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20020101 AS INT)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20030101 AS INT)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20040101 AS INT)
        ) a
;

-- Iterate over the partition boundaries and split the table

DECLARE @c INT = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM #partitions)
,       @i INT = 1                     --iterator for while loop
,       @q NVARCHAR(4000)              --query
,       @p NVARCHAR(20)     = N''      --partition_number
,       @s NVARCHAR(128)    = N'dbo'   --schema
,       @t NVARCHAR(128)    = N'table' --table
;

WHILE @i <= @c
BEGIN
    SET @p = (SELECT ptn_no FROM #partitions WHERE seq_no = @i);
    SET @q = (SELECT N'ALTER TABLE '+@s+N'.'+@t+N' SPLIT RANGE ('+@p+N');');

    -- PRINT @q;
    EXECUTE sp_executesql @q;

    SET @i+=1;
END

-- Code clean-up

DROP TABLE #partitions;
```

With this approach the code in source control remains static and the partitioning boundary values are allowed to be dynamic; evolving with the warehouse over time.
