# Pivot and unpivot data in SQL Data Warehouse

You can pivot data in SQL Data Warehouse by using a CASE statement. 

This article contains two simple examples on how to both pivot and unpivot a table without using the pivot and unpivot syntax found in SQL Server.

## Pivot

```
CREATE TABLE AnnualSales_pvt
WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN
        )
AS
WITH SalesPVT 
AS
(   SELECT  [EnglishProductCategoryName]
    ,       CASE WHEN [CalendarYear] = 2001 THEN SUM([SalesAmount]) ELSE 0 END AS 'CY_2001'
    ,       CASE WHEN [CalendarYear] = 2002 THEN SUM([SalesAmount]) ELSE 0 END AS 'CY_2002'
    ,       CASE WHEN [CalendarYear] = 2003 THEN SUM([SalesAmount]) ELSE 0 END AS 'CY_2003'
    ,       CASE WHEN [CalendarYear] = 2004 THEN SUM([SalesAmount]) ELSE 0 END AS 'CY_2004'
    FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales] s
    JOIN    [dbo].[DimDate] d               ON s.[OrderDateKey]          = d.[DateKey]
    JOIN    [dbo].[DimProduct] p            ON s.[ProductKey]            = p.[ProductKey]
    JOIN    [dbo].[DimProductSubCategory] u ON p.[ProductSubcategoryKey] = u.[ProductSubcategoryKey]
    JOIN    [dbo].[DimProductCategory] c    ON u.[ProductCategoryKey]    = c.[ProductCategoryKey]
    GROUP BY 
            [EnglishProductCategoryName]
    ,       [CalendarYear]
)
SELECT  [EnglishProductCategoryName]
,       SUM([CY_2001])  AS 'CY_2001'
,       SUM([CY_2002])  AS 'CY_2002'
,       SUM([CY_2003])  AS 'CY_2003'
,       SUM([CY_2004])  AS 'CY_2004'
FROM    SalesPVT
GROUP BY 
        [EnglishProductCategoryName]
;
```

## Unpivot

Unpivoting is a little bit more complex. However, it is still very achievable using `CASE`. For this you will also need to first determine how many columns you are going to unpivot. In the previous example we pivoted four columns. Let's stick with that. To perform the Unpivot we will need to amplify the dataset temporarily by a factor of 4. This results in a two step process:

Firstly, create a temporary table containing four rows. We will use this to amplify the data:

```
CREATE TABLE #Nmbr
WITH 
(   DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN
,   LOCATION     = USER_DB
)
AS
SELECT 1 AS 'Number'
UNION ALL
SELECT 2
UNION ALL
SELECT 3
UNION ALL
SELECT 4
OPTION (LABEL = 'CTAS : #Nmbr : CREATE')
;
```

The second step is to use CASE to conditionally unpivot the data back converting the set back into rows. To achieve this we will need to create a cartesian product of by joining to the temporary taable #Nmbr created in the first step: 

```
SELECT  [EnglishProductCategoryName]
,       CASE    c.[Number]
                WHEN 1 THEN [CY_2001]
                WHEN 2 THEN [CY_2002]
                WHEN 3 THEN [CY_2003]
                WHEN 4 THEN [CY_2004]
        END as Sales
FROM AnnualSales_pvt
JOIN #Nmbr c ON 1=1
WHERE   CASE    c.[Number]
                WHEN 1 THEN CY_2001
                WHEN 2 THEN CY_2002
                WHEN 3 THEN CY_2003
                WHEN 4 THEN CY_2004
        END IS NOT NULL
OPTION (LABEL = 'Unpivot :  : SELECT')
;
```

Finally don't forget to clean up by dropping the temporary table.

```
DROP TABLE #Nmbr
;
```
